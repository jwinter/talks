# Basics of a Splunk Search

class: center, middle

# Switch to splunk.com here

---

# Example search
Search for logs for "handled_request" for the last ten minutes of our "PAL" service in prod

`earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request`

* Let's run it

---

# source
* generally a specific logfile
 * `source=/var/log/syslog`
 * `source=/opt/ds/tomcat-partnerItgLayer/logs/partnerItgLayer_0.log`
 * `source=/opt/ds/tomcat-partnerItgLayer/logs/partnerItgLayer_access.log`

---

# sourcetype
* usually your app
 * sourcetype=pal
 * sourcetype=XreGuide 

---

# tags
* we tag with prod or staging, but tags can be other things

---

#  times
 * earliest=-4h # relative
 * earliest=-7d
 * earliest=04/13/2016:01:50:00 latest=04/13/2016:07:50:00

---

# mode
* Fast / Smart

---

# cid or id or transaction-id or ...
 * teams don't use the same transaction-id across services at $WORK :(
 * Money

---

# Pipes
* Can pipe together splunk commands like unix pipes
* Can chain multiple pipes

---

# Example:

.

> `earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request | rex field=_raw "idType=(?<idtype>.*?)( |&)" `

# Explanation

> `earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request | rex field=_raw "idType=(?<idtype>.*?)( |&)" `

- rex is run a regular expression to extract a new field
- field=_raw means run the regex against the whole log line (not just one field in it)
- ?&lt; idtype &gt; is splunk format for extracting the field
- does that mostly make sense? ^

# Charts
* timechart
 * my favorite splunk tool

> `sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request elapsedMs > 1000 | timechart span=5m count by stack`

---

# Stats
* perc99 (or perc90, perc10, etc)

> sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request  | timechart span=2m perc99(elapsedMs) by stack

---

# Designing your app for splunk
* `some_key=some_value`

---

# Questions we answer with it
1. Are our responses slower?
1. Is our cache hit ratio off?
1. Is problem X in one data center but not another?
1. Are we excessively hitting some service (or is some service excessively hitting us)?

---

# Scenarios we've been in

## "Our 99th is fine" vs "You literally time out every other call"
* REMEMBER splunk only shows what was logged

---

# Scenarios we've been in
##  We're getting crushed by load, what's going on?
* Aggregate calls, find outliers

---

# Scenarios we've been in
## "Seeing 1 million slow responses in client log" vs "Seeing 100k slow responses in server log"
* Duplicate events

---

# Scenarios we've been in
## These events are completely out of order

---

# Conclusion

---

The end
