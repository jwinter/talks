# What's splunk
* Storing / Searching "event stream"
** What is it really?
*** Log collection, aggregation, and search
*** every backend service at $WORK logs to splunk (pretty much)
* short presentation, but splunk is slow :)

---

# Can turn a bad day into a satisfying day

---

# Why splunk
- correlate events across services/teams at $WORK
- every backend service is in splunk
- ohnoohnoohnoohnowhathavewedone OR look these guys are idiots
- real evidence to prove/disprove theories about what's actually going on in prod

---

# Search
- bread and butter splunk
- we'll cover this quite a bit
- you can do this on your own

---

# Dashboards
- building them for your app
- you can build these on your own
- lotta different charts/metrics you can show
- Show BOWS dashboard
- ^ insert secret link
- not gonna cover this

---

# Alerts
- oh shit
- you need to engage splunk team to create these
- you need this or something like this if you're running a service at our scale

---

# What we're also not gonna cover
- splunk infrastructure
-- heads, forwarders, indexers, etc
-- I don't know how those work anyway

---

# Basics

---

# source
 * generally a specific logfile
 * syslog, access.log, gc.log, etc

---

# sourcetype
* usually your app

---

# tags
* we tag with prod or staging, but tags can be other things

---

#  times
 * earliest=-4h
 * earliest=-7d
 * earliest=04/13/2016:01:50:00 latest=04/13/2016:07:50:00

---

# mode
* I generally run in "Smart" mode even tho it's slow
 * auto-discovers fields even if I didn't specify in search
* if things are especially slow, I switch to "Fast"
 * only fields specified are shown, can be annoying

---

* cid or id or transaction-id or ...
 * teams don't use the same transaction-id across services at $WORK :(
 * would be nice
 * Money is a logging systems that folks are trying to standardize on

---

# Example search
Search for logs for "handled_request" for the last ten minutes of our "PAL" service in prod

`earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request`

* Let's run it

---

# Show fields, mode, export, stop in that search

---

# Expand a log line, show how to see context
* "Show source" shows the log in context from that node
 * What happened before this exception, slow request, whatever

---

# Pipes
- Can pipe together splunk commands like unix pipes
- You can keep chaining multiple pipes; extract a field and search on it for example

---

# Example:

.
.

> `earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request | rex field=_raw "idType=(?<idtype>.*?)( |&)" `


---
# Explanation

> `earliest=-10m sourcetype=pal tag=rialto-prod handled_request | rex field=_raw "idType=(?<idtype>.*?)( |&)" `

- rex is run a regular expression to extract a new field
- field=_raw means run the regex against the whole log line (not just one field in it)
- ?&lt; idtype &gt; is splunk format for extracting the field
- does that mostly make sense? ^

---

# Charts
- timechart
-- my favorite splunk tool

---

# Stats
- perc99
- average/means are garbage; don't even bother
-- no one cares that your mean request was 10ms when your 99th percentile was 3 seconds

---

# Designing your app for splunk
* `some_key=some_value`
* ^--- that's how splunk expects data to enter its system
* Think about the events that might be useful to measure (you probably have already)

---

# Questions we answer with it
1. Are our responses slower?
-- earliest=-14d (splunk goes back ~30 days, don't count on more than about 15 days)
1. Is our cache hit ratio off?
1. Is problem X in one data center but not another?
1. Are we excessively hitting some service (or is some service excessively hitting us)?

Inspecting source code is the map, not the terrain; splunk is reality (at least in the past)

---

# Scenarios we've been in

## "Our 99th is fine", "You literally time out every other call"
* REMEMBER splunk only shows what was logged
* networks drop packets, netsplits happen
 * if your 99th is fine, but your clients say you're awful, then call networking team
 * splunk can't help you here

---

# Scenarios we've been in
##  We're getting crushed, what's going on?
* aggregate calls, find outliers
 * less than 1000 devices making millions of requests
 * "average" device was making a completely reasonable # of requests

---

# Scenarios we've been in
## These events are completely out of order
* Session deleted before session was even requested?!
* millisecond precision vs (*sigh*) second precision
* session was requested, created, deleted within a single second

---

# Splunk can be a painful tool to use, but is essential to know what is going on here
* I never thought I'd be someone doing a splunk presentation here. I hated it when I started
* It's not the future tho, explicitly publishing rather than default logging is

The end
